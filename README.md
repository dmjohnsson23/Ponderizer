# Ponderizer
An app that facilitates pondering and memorizing (ponderizing) scripture passages in the Holy Bible, the Book of Mormon, and other books of scripture in [the standard works of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints](http://scriptures.lds.org).

In their General Conference in October, Latter-day Saints (also known as [Mormons](http://mormon.org)) were encouraged to ponder and memorize - or "ponderize" - scriptures on a regular basis. This app is made to make that easy and fun.
