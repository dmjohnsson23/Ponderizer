# ![ic_launcher](app/src/main/res/mipmap-hdpi/ic_launcher.png)Ponderizer 
An app that facilitates pondering and memorizing (ponderizing) scripture passages in the Holy Bible, the
Book of Mormon, and other books of scripture in [the standard works of The Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints](http://scriptures.lds.org).

In their General Conference in October 2015, Latter-day Saints (also known as [Mormons](http://mormon.org))
were encouraged to ponder and memorize - or "ponderize" - scriptures on a regular basis. This app is made
to make that easy and fun.
