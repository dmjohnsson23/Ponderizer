# ![ic_launcher](app/src/main/res/mipmap-hdpi/ic_launcher.png)Ponderizer
An app that facilitates pondering and memorizing (ponderizing) scripture passages in the Holy Bible, the Book of Mormon, and other books of scripture in [the standard works of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints](http://scriptures.lds.org).

In their General Conference in October 2015, Latter-day Saints (also known as [Mormons](http://mormon.org)) were encouraged to ponder and memorize - or "ponderize" - scriptures on a regular basis. This app is made to make that easy and fun.

The app icon was created using the [Android Asset Studio](http://romannurik.github.io/AndroidAssetStudio/index.html) by [Roman Nurik](https://github.com/romannurik), which generates content licensed under the [CC-BY 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) license.
